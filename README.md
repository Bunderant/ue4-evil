# ue4-evil
A virtual re-creation of Sam Raimi's "evil" camera in Unreal Engine 4. 

This project is in its very early stages, intended as a fun playground for putting my endless consumption of Unreal Engine courses and tutorials into practice. Once it progresses to a point where I'm satisfied with the controls, sound design, and visual fidelity, I'm hoping to add a cabin and some hapless young adults to terrorize and hopefully turn into Deadites, really giving this thing some gameplay and resulting in kind a direct-your-own horror experience. 

Ash Williams may end up with a cameo, but don't be disappointed if it's just a chalk outline on the wall.  

The more immediate goals are currently laid out on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/i1jySalp/).
